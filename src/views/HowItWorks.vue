    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <p>Not everyone can afford to pay Realtor fees of four, five or even six percent of their property's value when selling their home or apartment.</p>
    <p>Our platform helps buyers and sellers of homes and apartments create lawyer-ready sales agreements.</p>
    <p>We walk you through the agreement in simple language and then convert that into a convenient, lawyer-ready pdf</p>
    <p>That's our current solution, but we can't wait for you to see some of the exciting ideas and features we have in the works!</p>
